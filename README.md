# Computer-Graphics-WebGL
This project demonstrates the usage of WebGL technology to create a web interface that displays the letters "MA" in a rotating fashion. It includes a set of buttons to control the rotation speed and direction, as well as the ability to position the letters in different locations on the web interface.

# Contents
The project contains the following files and directories:

- common/: This directory includes common resources used by the project.
- project/: This directory includes the main files and logic for the project.
- WebGLMA.html: The HTML file that serves as the web interface for displaying the "MA" letters.
- WebGLMA.js: The JavaScript file that handles the button actions and rotation functionality.
- WebGLMA.pdf: A PDF document providing detailed explanations and documentation for the project.

# Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/Computer-Graphics-WebGL.git.
2. Open the WebGLMA.html file in a web browser.
3. You will see the letters "MA" displayed on the web interface.
4. Use the buttons provided to control the rotation, color and position of the letters:
- StartRotation button for Rotate Clockwise: Click this button to rotate the letters in a clockwise direction.
- Change Rotation Direction button for Rotate Counterclockwise: Click this button to rotate the letters in a counterclockwise direction.
- StopRotation button for Stop Rotation: Click this button to stop the rotation of the letters.
- Change The Color part for letters color: Choose the color what you want to see letters and click select button, then you see the changes.
- Reposition: LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN button change position of the LETTERS(MA) almost 10px.
- Increase or Decrease Speed: Click and drag the cylinder to increase or decrease the rotation speed of the letters.
- Top Left: Click this button to position the letters in the top-left corner of the web interface.
- Top Right: Click this button to position the letters in the top-right corner of the web interface.
- Bottom Right: Click this button to position the letters in the bottom-right corner of the web interface.
- Bottom Left: Click this button to position the letters in the bottom-left corner of the web interface.

# Additional Information
